## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first layout using React.js! I need to get used to the React environment, starting with small projects. It went well, I think. I ran into some issues, but solved them quite quickly.

### Continued development

I will continue using React.js and improve with every layout.
